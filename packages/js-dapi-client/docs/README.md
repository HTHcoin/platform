Client library used to access HTH DAPI endpoints

This library enables HTTP-based interaction with the HTH blockchain and HTH
Platform via the decentralized API ([DAPI](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/dapi))
hosted on HTH masternodes.

 - `DAPI-Client` provides automatic server (masternode) discovery using either a default seed node or a user-supplied one
 - `DAPI-Client` maps to DAPI's [RPC](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/dapi/tree/master/lib/rpcServer/commands) and [gRPC](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/dapi/tree/master/lib/grpcServer/handlers) endpoints
