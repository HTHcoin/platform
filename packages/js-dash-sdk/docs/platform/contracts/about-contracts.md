## What is a contract 

Contracts are a [registered](../../examples/publishing-a-new-contract.md) set of rules defined in a [JSON Application Schema](../../getting-started/core-concepts#schemas).

See more on the HTH Platform documentation about [Data Contract](https://hthplatform.readme.io/docs/explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract).
