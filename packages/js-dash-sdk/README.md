## Install

### ES5/ES6 via NPM

In order to use this library, you will need to add it to your project as a dependency.

Having [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed, just type : `npm install hth` in your terminal.

```sh
npm install hth
```


### CDN Standalone

For browser usage, you can also directly rely on unpkg : 

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/hth"></script>
```

## Usage

```js
const HTH = require("hth");

const client = new HTH.Client({
  network: "testnet",
  wallet: {
    mnemonic: "arena light cheap control apple buffalo indicate rare motor valid accident isolate",
  },
});

// Accessing an account allow you to transact with the HTH Network
client.getWalletAccount().then(async (account) => {
  console.log("Funding address", account.getUnusedAddress().address);

  const balance = account.getConfirmedBalance();
  console.log("Confirmed Balance", balance);

  if(balance > 0){
    // Creating an identity is the basis of all interactions with the HTH Platform
    const identity = await client.platform.identities.register()
    
    // Prepare a new document containing a simple hello world sent to a hypothetical tutorial contract
    const document = await platform.documents.create(
      'tutorialContract.note',
      identity,
      { message: 'Hello World' },
    );

    // Broadcast the document into a new state transition
    await platform.documents.broadcast({create:[document]}, identity);
  }
});
```

## Dependencies 

The HTH SDK works using multiple dependencies that might interest you:
- [Wallet-Lib](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/platform/tree/master/packages/wallet-lib) - Wallet management for handling, signing and broadcasting transactions (BIP-44 HD).
- [Hthcore-Lib](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/hthcore-lib) - Provides the main L1 blockchain primitives (Block, Transaction,...).
- [DAPI-Client](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dapi-client) - Client library for accessing DAPI endpoints.
- [DPP](https://github.com/MichaelHDesigns/platform/tree/master/packages/js-dpp) - Implementation (JS) of HTH Platform Protocol.

Some features might be more extensive in those libs, as HTH SDK only wraps around them to provide a single interface that is easy to use (and thus has less features).
